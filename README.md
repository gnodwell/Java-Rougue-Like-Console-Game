I did this work for this assignment on my own without copying work from any other sources.

./gradlew build
./gradlew assemble
./gradlew run


first download from git using --
git clone https://git.socs.uoguelph.ca/2430-01F20/gnodwell/project.git

next switch to A3 branch using git checkout A3

from here you can use gradle build or ./gradlew build and then gradle run or ./gradlew run

it will then open a terminal, you must click on the terminal to set the cursor on your screen so it knows you are trying to give it input
This may take a few seconds for it to finish setting up the game, until then you may not be able to move, just be patient it will work.
if you pick up an item and it goes left just resize the screen, this is caused from a bug with the inventory being added
you can save the game,
you can also load the game, just doesn't work very well.
