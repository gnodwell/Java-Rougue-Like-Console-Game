I did this work for this assignment on my own without copying work from any other sources.

./gradlew build
./gradlew assemble
./gradlew run


first download from git using --
git clone https://git.socs.uoguelph.ca/2430-01F20/gnodwell/project.git

next switch to A2 branch using git checkout A2

from here you can use gradle build or ./gradlew build and then gradle run or ./gradlew run

it will the open a java terminal where you have to click on to move
you can move with your keys and can go in and out of doors

item managmenet is still not implemented yet.
